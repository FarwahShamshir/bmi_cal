This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Flutter. The app allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their BMI and provides a result indicating their health status based on the BMI value.

The app features a clean and user-friendly interface with a custom background image set at a subtle opacity, ensuring readability while adding a visual appeal. It's an ideal project for those learning Flutter or looking to understand basic user input handling and UI layering in mobile app development.
